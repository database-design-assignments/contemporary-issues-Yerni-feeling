# My viewpoints about articles related to the database 

In this document I will be discussing about importance of the security of the database and measures that Big Companies use to protect their data

## Article 1

This [article/blog](https://www.endpointprotector.com/blog/5-ways-big-companies-protect-their-data/) discusses about measures that Big Tech companies use to protect their data. According to this article around *60%* of mid size companies go out of the  business within **6 month** of a cyberattack, according to the [National Cyber Security Alliance](https://staysafeonline.org/). In my opinion, this number is very huge and it says that young startUps or organizations once scaled should immediately think about security measures and be very careful with the data flow. One of the  popular way to secure data is various encryption techniques, and it became essential step to protect sensitivity of tthe data

I strongly agree with measures and methods that companies make to create private information of the users, however I think it is also important for companies to not gather data from the external factors, like phone contacts, messages etc; as companies like FB do this. And app like "Signal" is great example of how company can make sure that no personal data is being leaked to the company and outside of it.

## Article 2

This [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marymeehan/2019/11/26/data-privacy-will-be-the-most-important-issue-in-the-next-decade/?sh=7d7a2e491882) that was published by  Mary  Meehan is very well-writeen about Data Privacy. There are millions and millions databases around the world and all of them save particular private data of the people; and it is essential for them to ensure that the company/rganization they trust in have best security to protect their data.    

Author of this article also mentiones that all big companies focus their attention to gathering of the data to then create a better development strategy and some of them can be unethical in some cases, for example voice-activated devices that are listening all the time. Every interaction of the user with a software is used to create some kind of data to improve the performance of it and it potentially cause data leak. It makes me think about the importance of the methods to protect all those information, all those private data that are stored in apps that are created by thousand amounts every minute
